(The above gif isn't one I made)


My website: https://petersketer.github.io/Stats220/
and a QR code for the fun of it check out https://barcode.tec-it.com/en if interested
https://barcode.tec-it.com/barcode.ashx?data=https%3A%2F%2Fpetersketer.github.io%2FStats220%2F&code=MobileQRUrl&eclevel=L

The purpose of this repo (for now anyway) is to showcase some of the assignments for my Stats220 course.

In the future it will probably become a repository for all of my coding work as well as some experiments and other fun stuff like that.

Until then have another bug Pokemon GIF
