(The above gif isn't one I made)


My website: https://petersketer.github.io/Stats220/

The purpose of this repo (for now anyway) is to showcase some of the assignments for my Stats220 course.

In the future it will probably become a repository for all of my coding work as well as some experiments and other fun stuff like that.

Until then have another bug Pokemon GIF
