 <!--- need to point to new meme when I make it --->
# Welcome to my website!

## This isn't the best meme in the world, it's just a tribute!
at the moment it just contains memes like this one I have made for Stats220 using R
![]()
``` <!--Code goes here when it is finished-->

```
The reason I wanted to make this meme was because there aren't enough good bug type Pokemon memes in the world (in my opinion). And what is better than a bug type Pokemon meme you might ask ... one that includes Stats as well of course. Because orange jacket guy is rejecting one option and embracing the other I wanted to make something that was positive for both options while still showing some change. So I chose a bug Pokemon (Combee) and it's evolution (Vespiquen) and had them act in an excited manner for the GIFs.

### What makes this tribute so great?
1. Stats is an interesting subject and gets a bad rap universally, probably because it gets misused to spread bad information.
2. Honestly, because I love Pokemon. And my favourite type to play with in any game is the Bug type.
3. The orange jacket guy meme has been over done and Stats is **always** fun ... just the level of excitement changes.

Also, in no particular order:
- Bugs are generally increadible creatures, able to survive in the harshest environments and perform feats that would be *impossible* for us mere humans.
- The Pokemon franchise is fun and wholesome entertainment that has something for everyone, both children and adults alike.
- and another thing

I made a lot of GIFs (it's was surprisingly easy, although a little tedious).
Here is my Heracross looking excited, hosted on my GIPHY page, enjoy :D .
